    <h1><strong>For a War Memorial</strong></h1>
    <br>
    <br>
  
    The hucksters haggle in the mart
    <br>
    The cars and carts go by;
    <br>
    Senates and schools go droning on;
    <br>
    For dead things cannot die.
    <br>
    <br>
    A storm stooped on the place of tombs
    <br>
    With bolts to blast and rive;
    <br>
    But these be names of many men
    <br>
    The lightning found alive.
    <br>
    <br>
    If usurers rule and rights decay
    <br>
    And visions view once more
    <br>
    Great Carthage like a golden shell
    <br>
    Gape hollow on the shore,
    <br>
    <br>
    Still to the last of crumbling time
    <br>
    Upon this stone be read
    <br>
    How many men of England died
    <br>
    To prove they were not dead.
    <br>
