    <h1><em>Modern Technology</em></h1>
    <br>
    Modern technology is great when it works
    <br>
    If you can handle all the buggy quirks
    <br>
    Patience is key when dealing with the conveniences
    <br>
    When pushing all the right buttons takes geniuses
    <br>
    <br>
    Modern technology is a great mind feeder
    <br>
    I keep a whole library in my e-reader
    <br>
    I went to read a book and what did I find
    <br>
    I pushed the button and the screen didn't shine
    <br>
    Modern technology is great for knowledge
    <br>
    More than you can learn in the greatest college
    <br>
    Anything you need to know is on the internet
    <br>
    And everything is accurate, it's a sure bet
    <br>
    <br>
    Modern technology is the great new way
    <br>
    So click away on your keyboard all day
    <br>
    Seeing daylight is not healthy anymore
    <br>
    There's no reason to ever go out the door
    <br>
    Modern technology saves tons of resources
    <br>
    Visiting friends belongs to the days of horses
    <br>
    Why visit friends when you can text day and night
    <br>
    Or see thousands on your favorite social site
    <br>
    <br>
    Modern technology can still improve
    <br>
    So we would never again need to move
    <br>
    Soon we will have a chip implanted
    <br>
    So we can take being connected for granted
    <br>
    <br>
