    <h1><strong>My Melody!</strong></h1>

    Amazing and beautiful,
    <br>
    not a flower or a tree.
    <br>
    Much prettier than that,
    <br>
    and only I can see.
    <br>
    <br>
    Loving and caring
    <br>
    right down to the core.
    <br>
    Filling me with happiness
    <br>
    and so much more.
    <br>
    <br>
    Eyes are so stunning,
    <br>
    cannot look away.
    <br>
    Gorgeous and shining
    <br>
    all throughout the day.
    <br>
    <br>
    Here in your arms
    <br>
    is where I belong.
    <br>
    The beating of your heart
    <br>
    is like a beautiful song.
