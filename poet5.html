    <h1><em>Forest Delights</em></h1>
    <br>
    Leaves fluttering on a gentle breeze,
    <br>
    Within the forest of whispering trees,
    <br>
    Makes sunlight gracefully dance there,
    <br>
    Upon the ground and everywhere.
    <br>
    Dappling streams with sparkling light,
    <br>
    Catching the colors of birds in flight,
    <br>
    Giving flowers a lovely surreal glow,
    <br>
    Rousing our spirits with nature's show.
    <br>
    <br>
    Nightfall gives the forest a mysterious allure
    <br>
    As trees become shadows of what they were;
    <br>
    Soon a chorus arises deep in forest thickets,
    <br>
    From the croaking frogs and chirping crickets,
    <br>
    Blending in the whip-poor-wills' lonely calls,
    <br>
    With the owls' echoing pleas in forest halls,
    <br>
    As fireflies scatter light upon a dark palette,
    <br>
    All beneath the mystic forest's starlit coverlet.
    <br>
    <br>
    Nature's melodic sounds are sure to enthrall,
    <br>
    As life's songs peal within a forest cathedral.
    <br>
    Nature adds the wind's timbre with a breeze,
    <br>
    Or the rain's resonating rhythm through leaves.
    <br>
    Merging with rippling sounds of forest streams,
    <br>
    All serenading restless minds into daydreams
    <br>
    That comforts those who seek refuge there.
    <br>
    If only they'll listen while in the forest's care.
    <br>
    <br>
    Thoughts become gentle among natural sights,
    <br>
    While our spirits entwine with forest delights,
    <br>
    Enticing us to hear life's natural gifts of mirth,
    <br>
    Inviting us to see the wondrous beauty of Earth,
    <br>
    As nature stirs feelings some cannot determine;
    <br>
    Yet, the subtle answers lie in a forest's sermon,
    <br>
    Urging us to listen to instincts we once knew,
    <br>
    To walk lightly on Earth as other creatures do.
