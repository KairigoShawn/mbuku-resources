    <h1><strong>Wrong decision!</strong></h1>
<br>
<br>
We lived in the lucky world—
not the far place where flies
<br>
<br>
sipped at eye corners
of children too weak to cry.
<br>
<br>
A camera showed that world to us
on posters. But we were children.
<br>
<br>
We wanted most to not be those
others, with their terrible bones.
<br>
<br>
We spoke of them wide-eyed, with
what we thought was tenderness.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
But our words came in a different register,
as if to speak of such betrayal
<br>
<br>
by the grown world could bring
a harm of great immensity
<br>
<br>
upon us too. We got to choose
from the cupboard. We gave
<br>
<br>
what we hated—beets, peas,
mushrooms. Our dreams
<br>
<br>
were not of rice. The moon
laid light on our bicycles propped
<br>
<br>
against the porch. Sycamores
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
became our giants standing guard;
the overgrown shrub, our fort. We thought
<br>
<br>
we understood what was required.
Even crouched beneath our desks
<br>
<br>
during drill, we said one prayer
for the fear, one for recess.
 <br>
 <br>
McClellan Air Force Base
sent forth big-bellied planes
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
that rattled the windows
of our houses. Evenings, we took
<br>
<br>
to the streets shrieking
with joy, rode madly fast
<br>
<br>
around the block. We collapsed
on the lawn breathless, the earth
<br>
<br>
cool beneath us & pounding hard,
as if it had one great heart.
<br>
<br>
As if it was ours.
