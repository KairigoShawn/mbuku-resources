    <h1><em>One Last Kiss</em></h1>
    <br>
    I have fought the feelings
    <br>
    And emotions inside
    <br>
    That fills and empties me,
    <br>
    Like a fast rolling tide.
    <br>
    <br>
    There are moments of pain,
    <br>
    Of sorrow and hate,
    <br>
    Leaving me to ponder
    <br>
    Many hours of late.
    <br>
    <br>
    I love you, honey.
    <br>
    It's your presence I miss.
    <br>
    And I terribly long
    <br>
    For that one last kiss.
    <br>
    <br>
    But the greatest pain of all
    <br>
    That hurts me so deep,
    <br>
    Is after giving you my love
    <br>
    I can't have yours to keep.
    <br>
    <br>
    To have you by my side
    <br>
    Always longing for more,
    <br>
    And have you feel the same,
    <br>
    To mutually adore.
    <br>
    <br>
    You see, my love, I have given you my heart
    <br>
    And revealed the depths of my soul,
    <br>
    And now I am left feeling hopelessly empty,
    <br>
    Paying this immeasurable toll.
    <br>
    <br>
    It's selfish, I know
    <br>
    To feel this way,
    <br>
    But it's how I feel
    <br>
    Each and every day
    <br>
    <br>
